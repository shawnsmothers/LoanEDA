## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises over 500,000 rows and more than 30 columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, the following steps were undertaken:

- Identified and removed columns with over 50% null values, resulting in the elimination of 5 columns.
- Transformed null values in a few columns to 0.
- Renamed and retained 16 columns.
- Conducted data visualization encompassing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
